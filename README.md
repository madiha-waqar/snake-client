# üêçThe Famous Snake Game
The game [Snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)) may already be familiar to you, as it is one of the classics! The original Snake game is a video game concept where the player manoeuvres a dot and grows it by ‚Äòeating‚Äô pieces of food. As it moves and eats, it grows and the growing snake becomes an obstacle to smooth manoeuvres. The goal is to grow the snake to become as long as possible without bumping into the side walls, or bumping into itself, upon which it dies.

## Credit Where Credit Due
Our server code for this game was not written from scratch. It is a heavily modified version of the single player game [Snek](https://github.com/taniarascia/snek) created by [Tania Rascia](https://github.com/taniarascia).

## Snek-Client Project
This project is made by [Madiha Waqar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/madiha-waqar-a8253827/?originalSubdomain=ca):raising_hand_woman: as part of [Lighthouse Labs](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/) Web Development Flex Program curriculum. Knowledge of previously learned concepts (callbacks, asynchronous control flow, modules in node, writing modular code, refactoring code, working with stdin) has been applied in bringing all the functionality into the game.

### How It Looks
